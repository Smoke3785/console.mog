Welcome to **console.mog**, a transformative tool designed to take our beloved `console` from mundane to magnificent. This library gives you the ability to create gorgeous terminal readouts without adopting the technical overhead that comes with a dedicated CLI-builder.

## Features üíÖüèª


#### üöÄ Transformative Logging Experience

- Looksmax your logs: Beautify your terminal output without breaking a sweat.
- Every native logging feature remains, but each has been [super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2zB8bLSpk)charged with added functionality and a brand new look.
-	Minimal setup: A single function call is all it takes to supercharge your console, but the powerful API enables deep customization!
- Add colors, links, and rainbow text to your logs with ease.

## Pre-Launch Requirements
Stuff I gotta do before shilling on reddit. ü§®üòó

This project is in the first phase of development. Here's a list of milestones to hit before releae:



### Critical for alpha üê∫
- Graceful failure. Currently crash reports are printed overtop of the console... can we wrap them to handle graceful failures?
- Make sure `console.mog` has parity with `console.log` - may need to just proxy stuff like chart to underlying functionality.
  - `console.time` and `console.profile` methods need hooks for the Timestamp system.
  - dir, dirxml - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/dir_static
  - `console.assert` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#using_string_substitutions
  - `console.count`
- Make native fallbacks for when this is run in the browser.
- Make readme

### Critical for literally anything useful
- Performance improvements. Obviously nowhere near as fast as native implementation, but there's *tremendous* room for performance improvements.
  - Currently dumb render starts from the top and goes down. That's silliness.
  - VSCode only renders 1,100-ish logs anyhow. Rendering only needs to be fancy for the last few thousand logs.
    - When the program exits / crashes, a static version of logs should be spat into the console. Nothing fancy.
- Determine interoperability with other logging libraries. 
- Determine interoperability with CLI tools that handle other stuff

### Future features
- `console.promise(promise)` syntax, `console.promiseAll(promises)` syntax.
- Render boxes, links, rainbow text.
  - `terminal.link()` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-link
- Create Toolbox interface that contains chalk, link, etc. and can be passed to every log.
- Create Context interface that contains LogData, selected DOM information, etc.
- Alignment api. Left, center, right align. Unsure how I'm going to do this. `console.center(console.log())` possible?
- `SideEffect` class + `sideEffects` config option, that will do other stuff with your logs when they occur. Builtins:
  - `FileSystem` will dump your logs in a file, nuff said.
  - `Discord` will turn your logs into a discord webhook.
  - `SimpleRemote` simple api for duplicating your logs as HTTP requests
  - `SimpleWebhook` is this redundant with above?
- `console.tree()` for directly rendering nested structures. May need a callback fn to run on every node to get `children` and `label`.
- Syntax highlighting in returned info - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-highlight
- Can be explicit `console.highlight("json", fs.readFileSync('./package.json'))`
  - Or implicit `console.log({keyOne: "string", keyTwo: 5, keyThree: [1,2,3]})`
- `console.directory()`?? - https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls#readme
- `console.styledTable()` more control over neat looking console.

 

### Code cleanup
- LogData should be generic - I need to simplify the Log types and how they actually resolve their data.
